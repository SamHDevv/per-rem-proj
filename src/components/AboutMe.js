                    <p>
                    From very early in my life, I started to fall in love with technology üòç This love has helped me develop a very good technological mindset and made me curious to learn more.
                    <br></br><br></br>
                    My passion for technology led me to browse programming on my own and opt for a Full-Stack web development Bootcamp, gaining knowledge in HTML5, CSS, Javascript, React, Python / Flask, SQL, Git, Github, command line.
                    <br></br><br></br>
                    I am curious and restless by nature, I have a wide disposition for teamwork, as well as a facility to learn in a self-taught way; respectful and patient, with availability to dialogue and ability to solve problems.
                    <br></br><br></br>
                    I really want to learn and face new professional challenges as a programmer; joining any interesting project that I can help with.
